Living things adapt to their environment so they 
can survive. An organism adapts when it develops a behavior
that makes it more likely to survive. 
It can also adapt by forming a physical characteristic or body 
part that helps it survive.
In a forest biome, some trees grow taller than the 
other plants around them. This lets them reach the 
sunlight. Growing taller is an adaptation that helps 
trees survive. Shorter plants have adapted with their 
behavior. They have learned to live in the shade with 
less sunlight. 
Animals in the forest have a wide variety of 
adaptations. Monkeys have long tails. They can use 
them almost like another hand. This helps them swing 
quickly through the tops of trees. They can even 
do this while holding their babies or gathering food. 
Giraffes need to reach leaves at the tops of tall trees. 
Having a long neck is an adaptation that allows them 
to do this.
Some animals? adaptations prevent other animals 
from wanting to eat them. A skunk?s horrible smell 
makes larger animals choose something else to eat. 
Even plants sometimes protect themselves in this 
way. Roses and acacia trees both have dangerous 
thorns. The thorns prevent animals from eating 
their leaves.
